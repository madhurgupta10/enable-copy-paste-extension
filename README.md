# ✂️ Enable Copy Paste Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension automatically removes copy-paste and right-click restrictions from all websites. It also gives you full control with a site-specific toggle and persistent exclusions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Enables copy, paste, text selection, and right-click on all websites
- 🔘 Toggle functionality per website via extension popup
- 🧠 Remembers your preferences using Chrome storage
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast — no background scripts needed
- 🔒 Open source and privacy-friendly (no data is collected)

## 🛠 How It Works

- On each website, the extension checks if it’s in your **excluded list**.
- If not excluded, it removes all common JavaScript-based blocks on:
  - `copy`, `paste`, `cut`
  - `right-click` (`contextmenu`)
  - `text selection`
- You can click the extension icon to **disable or re-enable** it for the current site.
